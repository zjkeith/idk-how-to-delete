        Very little is known about Lord Phobos' origins. During a Reddit AMA with the band in 2016, it was claimed that Phobos was born with a guitar in his hand. In a video interview with Noisography in 2012, he claims that he was born in two places at once. It wasnâ€™t until interviews in 2015 when more information about the enigmatic guitarist came to light. According to Doctor Sung, Phobos is a philosophical rocketeer from a race of scientific and culturally advanced people several millennia in the future. His civilization was destroyed by Commander Meouch, possibly when he smuggled funk to the people. Enraged and hungry for revenge, Lord Phobos pursued Meouch into space. The conflict between the two was pacified when Doctor Sung exited a wormhole into the middle of the battle. For reasons unspecified, Phobos took a sacred vow of silence.
