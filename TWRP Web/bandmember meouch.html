        Meouch began playing bass when he was 8 months old, in cat years. Prior to joining TWRP, Meouch made a fortune as a space pirate, smuggling funk to “historically square” star systems. He is also responsible for destroying Lord Phobos’ home world and civilization. He maintains that he has a deeply sexual relationship with his instrument. Meouch has been called the sassiest member of TWRP by his bandmates. He also has a deep-seeded mistrust of journalists, as evidenced in Dave Hurlow’s account of his time spent with the band. While not known for attacking humans, Meouch’s favorite food is Human with Guacamole. Commander Meouch has a niece and nephew, Pearl and Dangus.
