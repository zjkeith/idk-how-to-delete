        Havve became a member of Tupper Ware Remix Party when Doctor Sung, Lord Phobos, and Commander Meouch traveled through time to the Mesozoic Period and picked him up. The band has named him “least responsible” for the fact that he has “Killed a lot of people for no reason”. In a 2015 interview, Doctor Sung explained that Havve was known to maim and murder early Homo sapiens, but the behavior was excused on account of Havve’s ability to keep perfect time. He went on to mention that Havve "hasn't killed in months" which may suggest that his murderous tendencies are getting under control. Although mute, Havve possesses a telepathic link with Doctor Sung whom he uses as an interpreter[citation needed]. Sung has also stated that Havve was not programmed to understand sexual innuendo, so one must be careful with what is said around the drummer[citation needed].
