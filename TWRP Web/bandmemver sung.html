        Early in his existence, Doctor Sung’s parents died of sadness. Wrought with loss and bitter anger, Doctor swore he would find the cure for all sadness and misery, and rid the universe of it forever. Ceaselessly, Doctor toiled in his fifth-dimensional lab; distilling time, volatilizing thoughts, and depurating matter, he discovered no cure for pain. After millennia, almost ready to give up his search for the invention to end all woe, he stumbled upon what he had searched for all his life - groove. Through rarefying sound molecules and quantuminating certain sonic frequencies to pleasurable levels, he found he could trigger the subconscious minds’ synaptical nodes to emit feelings of complete euphoria. The side-effects of this euphoric state manifested themselves physically through the gyration of hips, the thrusting of pelvises, and the bobbing of heads - Doctor later conceived the word “dancing” to describe the physical reactions of groove. And so through spreading groove, Doctor Sung set out to end sadness and despair across all space and time. With the rest of existence living in complete harmony, Doctor arrived with his colleagues at the last destination where fear, hatred, and pain still reigned – the first dimension, the home of the remote planet Earth.
